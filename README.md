CLI and Javascript library for packaging a remote web archive collection into a single [WACZ file](https://specs.webrecorder.net/wacz/1.1.1/).

```bash
wacz-preparator --extractor "archive-it" --username "lil" --password $PASSWORD --collection-id 12345
```

## Foreword

‚ö†Ô∏èü•ºüß™ **Experimental:**

This pipeline was originally developed in the context of [The Harvard Library Innovation Lab](https://lil.law.harvard.edu)'s partnership with the [Radcliffe Institute's Schlesinger Library](https://www.radcliffe.harvard.edu/schlesinger-library) on [experimental access to web archives](https://www.schlesinger-metooproject-radcliffe.org/access-the-collection).

We have only tested it on [The Schlesinger #meToo Web Archives collection](https://www.schlesinger-metooproject-radcliffe.org/web-archives) and would welcome feedback from the community to help solidify it.

In particular, we would love to hear more about:

- Any edge cases this pipeline currently doesn't account for.
- General interest in exploring new ways of storing, copying, and giving access to web archives

## How does it work?

Given a specific extractor and valid combination of credentials, **wacz-preparator** will perform the following steps in order to pull and package a remote web archives collection into a single WACZ file.


### Example: Archive-It Extractor

| # | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | -- |
| 01 | Check validity of credentials and access to the collection | | 
| 02 | Create local collection folder if not already present | Because the underlying files are kept around in that folder, processing can be interrupted, resumed, and run multiple times over. | 
| 03 | Pull Collection Information | |
| 04 | Pull list of available WARC files | |
| 05 | Pull crawl information for all WARC files | This includes retrieving **seeds** (urls).|
| 06 | Pull page title for all of the crawled URLs | Will first try to fetch that information from the **seed** meta data. If not available, will try to pull that information from the **Wayback Machine**. |
| 07 | Delete _"loose"_ WARCs from local collection folder | This comparison allows for discarding WARC files that may have previously been pulled locally but are no longer part of the collection. |
| 08 | Compare hashes of local WARC files against remote hashes (1) | This allows for determining what files need to be downloaded or re-downloaded. |
| 09 | Pull WARC files | Only the files that are not already present locally will be pulled. |
| 10 | Compare hashes of local WARC files against remote hashes (2) | At this stage, there should be no discrepancies. |
| 11 | Build pages list | | 
| 12 | Prepare WACZ file | |

At the end of this process, **a WACZ file named after the collection ID should be available (ie: 12345.wacz)**. 

WACZ files can be read with any compatible playback software, such as [replayweb.page](https://replayweb.page).

**Note:** All of the operations that involve talking to the Archive-It API are run in parallel batches: the `--concurrency` option allows for determining how many requests can be run in parallel.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies 
**wacz-preparator** requires [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/en/). 

### Compatibility
This program has been written for UNIX-like systems and is expected to work on **Linux, Mac OS, and Windows Subsystem for Linux**.

### Installation
**wacz-preparator** is available on [npmjs.org](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@harvard-lil/wacz-preparator) and can be installed as follows:
 
```bash
# As a CLI
npm install -g @harvard-lil/wacz-preparator

# As a library
npm install @harvard-lil/wacz-preparator --save
```

## CLI

Here are a few examples of how **wacz-preparator** can be used in the command line to extract a full collection from Archive-It into a WACZ file:

```bash
# The program needs an Archive-It username, password, and collection-id to operate ...
wacz-preparator --extractor "archive-it" --username 'foo' --password 'bar' --collection-id 12345

# ... the latter can / should be passed as an environment variable
wacz-preparator --extractor "archive-it"  --username 'foo' --password $PASSWORD --collection-id 12345

# Unless specified otherwise with --output-path, wacz-preparator will work in the current directory
wacz-preparator --extractor "archive-it"  --output-path "/path/to/directory" --username 'foo' --password $PASSWORD --collection-id 12345

# The resulting WACZ file can be signed using an authsign-compatible endpoint.
# See: https://specs.webrecorder.net/wacz-auth/0.1.0/#implementations
wacz-preparator --extractor "archive-it" --signing-url "https://example.com/sign" --username foo --password $PASSWORD --collection-id 12345

# Use --help to list the available options, and see what the defaults are.
wacz-preparator --help
```

## JavaScript Library

**wacz-preparator** can also be used as JavaScript library in a Node.js project. 

### Example: Using the Preparator.process() method
```javascript
import { ArchiveItExtractor } from "@harvard-lil/wacz-preparator"

const collection = new ArchiveItExtractor({
  username: 'username', 
  password: 'password', 
  collectionId: 12345
})

if (await collection.process()) {
  // WACZ file is ready!
  // ... 
}
```

The `process()` method runs through all the steps described in the ["How does it work?"](how-does-it-work) section.

It is also possible to go through each individual step manually and customize the behavior of **wacz-preparator**.

## Development

### Standard JS
This codebase uses the [Standard JS](https://standardjs.com/) coding style. 
- `npm run lint` can be used to check formatting.
- `npm run lint-autofix` can be used to check formatting _and_ automatically edit files accordingly when possible.
- Most IDEs can be configured to automatically check and enforce this coding style.

### JSDoc
[JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) is used for both documentation and loose type checking purposes on this project.

### Testing
> ‚ö†Ô∏è In its current state, this experimental codebase doesn't come with an automated test suite. 

### Available CLI

```bash
# Runs linter
npm run lint

# Runs linter and attempts to automatically fix issues
npm run lint-autofix

# Step-by-step NPM publishing helper
npm run publish-util
```
